An aggregation of my work in Systems "MKS65"

* Note

  Extremely WIP, haven't figured out renaming and structure yet. For now, I'm just =git subtree='ing
  some of the repos in, though others remain private or on other people's profiles (quite a tedious
  process finding all of them).

  Stay tuned... if you want :shipit:
